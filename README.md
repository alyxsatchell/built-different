Built Different is a basic physics engine capable of accurately simulating collisions of circles. It can accurately simulate the motion of multiple circles in 2 dimensions given coefficients of restitution for the collisions and the starting conditions of the circles. It also features an ASCII-based graphics engine for a graphical representation in the terminal in the form of Constellation (https://github.com/alyxsatchell/constellation). It was written both as a passion project and a prototype for future projects with physics simulations.
